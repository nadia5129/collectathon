## Understanding
- the include section is like a library for our games needs

- "static constexpr bn::fixed SPEED = 1;" is a constant for the speed. you can change the speed here. 

- "bn::core::init();" Initializing the Butano Engine 

- the while loop is stating if the left button is held the speed of the game decreases and if the right button is held the speed increased.
